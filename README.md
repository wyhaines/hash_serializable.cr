# hash_serializable

It can be useful to be able to serialize and deserialize between hashes
and objects the same way that one can between JSON and objects and YAML
and objects. This implementation is aiming to be feature-consistent with
JSON::Serializable and YAML::Serializable, while working with hashes.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     hash_serializable:
       github: your-github-user/hash_serializable
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "hash_serializable"
```
